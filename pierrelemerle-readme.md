# Manager Readme: Pierre Lemerle

_Dear Engineers,_

_I'm [Pierre Lemerle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-lemerle/), CTO at [Normative](https://normative.io/). This document aims to provide insights into my values, how I operate, my expectations, and ways we can collaborate effectively._

## Communication
**Open-Door Policy:** My door (virtual and physical) is always open. Feel free to reach out with any concerns, or ideas, or just to chat.

**Communication Style:** I value clear and honest communication. I also value concise communication which often is a challenge for me, so if a message seems unclear, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.

**Communication Channel:** I prefer and am more reactive to instant messages (Slack) rather than email. If a topic is tricky to explain: a quick call or, ideally, a face-to-face discussion is the best option.

**Virtual communication:** When working remotely, I encourage people to use their webcams. This is especially true in 1-1 or team meetings; this, of course, is not necessary in large audience meetings except when you are driving the meeting or presenting something.

**Feedback:** I appreciate direct and honest feedback. Rather, I do need it! Whether it is positive or constructive, it helps me to strive and grow. I also aim to provide regular feedback to help and mentor you in your development.

## Work Style

**Autonomy:** I trust you to take ownership of your work. I value individuals who drive their projects, and I'm here to support you. Embrace a proactive approach to problem-solving, and if you face obstacles, let's discuss potential solutions together.

**Flexibility:** I value flexibility in how and when you work. I tend to work and send late-hour messages; there's no expectation for an immediate response, nor for you to do the same. Work when it suits you best, maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial. If you face challenges, reach out and we'll find solutions together.

**Continuous Learning:** I'm passionate about development and growth. Let's discuss your career goals and work together to identify development opportunities.

## Meetings

**Purposeful Meetings:** Meetings should have a clear agenda and purpose, which must be visible in the meeting invite. For this reason, meetings must be prepared and ideally summarized at the end. Additionally, meetings should not exceed their allocated time.

**Calendar:** Book meetings in advance and avoid last-minute cancellations. My calendar is up to date and open, so use any available slots; if it's challenging, feel free to reach out to me with some slot suggestions, and I'll gladly adjust.

**1 on 1:** I run regular 1 on 1 with all my reports. These meetings are for you; it is best when you prepare and bring up your topics or concerns. I will set up a shared notepad to support and document these;

**Skip level 1 on 1:** I also like and try to run skip-level 1 on 1 with non-direct reports in my organization. It helps me to provide better guidance and ensures that people who do not use my open-door policy still get heard.

**Focus:** Aim at being focused and attentive, in the moment. This is always a challenge in this hyperconnected world, so let's help each other in that domain; I rely on real-life meetings whenever possible, which allows me to turn off electronics and be more focused.

## Values

Below are some of my core values, the guiding principles that drive me in both leadership and collaboration.

**Curiosity:** `Progress is born of doubt and inquiry.`

**Ownership:** `Commitment is the bridge between goals and accomplishments.`

**Teamwork:** `Success tastes better shared.`

**Growth:** `Learning is a lifelong process.` 

_I'm here to support you and help you grow and strive by fostering a positive work environment. All the expectations listed here are also obviously applicable to me in the first place, so please keep me accountable!_
_I'm excited to work with each of you._

_Best,_
_Pierre Lemerle_
